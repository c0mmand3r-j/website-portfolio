## Clean Error Records (Squarespace)
<img src="https://jamesb.online/images/ce.png"/>
The label sought to revamp their method of selling albums and delivering content to their fans. The primary objective was to revamp the website's logo and visual appearance. As the label specializes in experimental electronic music, it was important to create a futuristic and minimalistic design that was both easy to navigate and incorporated elements that represented the label's glitchy and abstract aesthetic. The music aligns with the cyberpunk art genre and has been a source of inspiration. Despite previous efforts to modify the website, a full relaunch and rebranding were deemed necessary to distinguish their digital products. The biggest challenge was updating their existing logo, which had become closely associated with the label in the minds of their audience. After multiple design iterations, I finally arrived at a new logo concept that perfectly complemented the overall design as I built the site.<br>

## Lokee hookah (Wix)
Lokee Hookah Lounge & Bar is an escape from the typical sports bar, a place where you can go after a long day of work to socialize with new and old friends alike. My main goal was to create a website that accurately reflected the relaxed, yet sophisticated vibe of the lounge itself. Starting with the design, I aimed for a modern, minimal look that was easy to navigate. I incorporated large, high-quality images of the lounge's interior, food and drinks to give visitors a feel for what they can expect when they visit in person. The menu is prominently displayed, making it easy for visitors to see what food and drinks are available, and I also made sure to highlight any special events or promotions taking place at the lounge.
